<h3>Architectural modelling versus designing?</h3><h3>In this article I want to explain why I believe that Enterprise Architects should spend less time on modelling and more on graphic design or visual communication. So, let’s compare these two and see what there is to gain for you as an Enterprise Architect.</h3><h4>Modeling</h4><h3>Modeling is an exercise whereby we draw a graphical representation of the system(s) in a formal pre-defined language. The goal is to use these models as means of communication and to record specs when building the system. UML, BPMN and Archimate are typical modeling languages whereby each box, line and arrow has a specific meaning. Modeling language in wikipedia:A<strong>modeling language</strong>is any<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_language" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_language" title="Artificial language">artificial language</a>that can be used to express<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information" title="Information">information</a>or<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a>or<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System" title="System">systems</a>in a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure" title="Structure">structure</a>that is defined by a consistent set of rules. The rules are used for interpretation of the meaning of components in the structure.The great thing about modeling is that people who understand the language, can communicate rapidly and without too much confusion what the model represents. Below is an example I drew recently. (note that I’m not very experienced in Archimate, so forgive me for any modeling mistakes)</h3><h4>Designing</h4><h3>A design can be considered as a plan, the specification, the cost, etc. However, I’m talking about the another type of design here; more to graphic design with a goal to get people on the same page using a visual communication technique.The Archimate picture above can be drawn in the following picture. So, we loose the formalism and spend more time on the visualisation. With this visualisation there comes a story.<em>(I recently bought a couple of very good whiteboard markers and I hope to improve my visual communication skills. This is my first attempt in explaining the same topic in a different manner.)</em>True, the more formal version is more transferable to people, if — and here’s the catch — if all its readers understand the formal language. Remember the custom made language Esperanto? Yes, of course some speak it, but most of us don’t. So, the transferability of the first drawing is rather limited.The second one is of course much more prone to interpretation, that’s why I would always tell the story with it while showing the image. Of course we could tell a story with the Archimate diagram as well, but this will be preceeded by 30 min of archimate basics, so long momentum…</h3><h4>Why I prefer designing</h4><h3>So, compare both images above. What do you like the best? Probably depends on your own knowledge level and background. There are a couple of points why I believe the designing approach is better:<strong>You don’t have to be the bottleneck</strong>Typically an enterprise architect discipline is heavy modeling oriented. In order to keep the model(s) of the organisation accurate and up to date, enterprise architects come up with a process whereby all change passes their department. This gives them the opportunity to update the model and to give their expert opinion, advice or sometimes even their command to the subject at hand. Of course, change is happening in a far more rapid pace than most EA teams can handle and a lot of change is below the radar.If there’s no need to update the models you won’t become the person or team nobody knows and dislikes because they can’t move forward with their own job. Get out of your office and help to make the change happen rather than the model it.<strong>Collaboration improves the result</strong>Exchange this modeling in the back exercise with simple light weight drawings on the whiteboard. You are in front of the people, they can feel your excitment, they learn and they’ll understand much better what it is you want to achieve in the organisation.When you draw on a whiteboard and when you explain in the meanwhile, people can get into your train of thoughts. It’s a story that builds up and people can interact and provide feedback improving it for you as well.<strong>Adaptive language</strong>Typically an Enterprise Architect would go to a meeting and have a copy printed out of a sub segment of the organisation or IT landscape. It is tailored for the audience and is called a viewpoint. When you lay down that model, and people start to look at it, they are usually overwhelmed by the sheer number of boxes, circles, arrows, lines, etc. So, you start to educate them about the visual language. So, half of your timeslot is wasted and people are too distracted. Often you feel you brought the wrong viewpoint or slide deck with you and you wish you could do it all over again.Leaving the models and standing at the whiteboard, you quickly, almost unconcious, learn what style of graphic design you can use in front of your audience. You draw, explain, listen, adapt and sometimes even people start to draw with you. That’s when you know, they are learning and co-creating the future with you.<strong>Focus on improvement</strong>I believe an Enterprise Architect main focus should be about improving the organisation rather than trying to control or govern it. Although the first has its purpose, improving and creating customer (/business) value is primordial imho.Most Enterprise Architects, including myself have a tendancy of starting with an<em>as-is</em>, then defining the<em>to-be</em>and making a plan for the difference, the<em>gap</em>in between these two states. Every time, I start with a formal language like Archimate I get sucked up in the formalism of the language and days, weeks go by where I’m deciding if it should be a full or open arrow. A lot of time gets wasted during the start of a project. Many organisations then decide to put much more time and effort into this<em>as-is</em>models, so next time there’s a project, they can speed up their project kickoff.I haven’t made any factual comparison between doing this big up-front “let’s get everything charted out” exercises and “let’s draw an as-is when we really need it”. Let’s follow some logic here. Imagine a company with 4 sub-systems. If I were the model them in one go, I would spent as much as time than I would draw them seperately. Tbh, doing it in one go would be slightly faster. However, the big waste is in keeping the models up to date. Imagine that I changed the big as-is model 17 times over the coarse of a year, this would become far more expensive then drawing things when <a href="http://needed.So" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">needed.So</a>, don’t fall into the trap of “I believe I can model the organisation and keep the model up to date”. Spent your energy rather on the solution and to-be scenario’s<strong>Help the business dream</strong>As an Enterprise Architect, you have the ability and skills to nudge people in the right direction. You can help them dream. You can discover the business and customer’s pains & gains and provide them with solutions and opportunities they never knew existed. You have the insight of the IT landscape, the technology trends. You’re in the right place to enable people and inspire them to make a change.Using good looking and easy to understand visual representations you can get people much faster on the same page. This in turn provides way more room for helping them in their premature thoughts and ideas. Present them with solutions and opportunities and get them thinking. Get them those precious aha-moments.</h3></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Architectural modelling versus designing?</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

What do you like the best? Probably depends on your own knowledge level and background. There are a couple of points why I believe the designing approach is better:You don’t have to be the bottleneckTypically an enterprise architect discipline is heavy modeling oriented. In order to keep the model(s) of the organisation accurate and up to date, enterprise architects come up with a process whereby all change passes their department. This gives them the opportunity to update the model and to give their expert opinion, advice or sometimes even their command to the subject at hand. Of course, change is happening in a far more rapid pace than most EA teams can handle and a lot of change is below the radar.If there’s no need to update the models you won’t become the person or team nobody knows and dislikes because they can’t move forward with their own job. Get out of your office and help to make the change happen rather than the model it.Collaboration improves the resultExchange this modeling in the back exercise with simple light weight drawings on the whiteboard. You are in front of the people, they can feel your excitment, they learn and they’ll understand much better what it is you want to achieve in the organisation.When you draw on a whiteboard and when you explain in the meanwhile, people can get into your train of thoughts. It’s a story that builds up and people can interact and provide feedback improving it for you as well.Adaptive languageTypically an Enterprise Architect would go to a meeting and have a copy printed out of a sub segment of the organisation or IT landscape. It is tailored for the audience and is called a viewpoint. When you lay down that model, and people start to look at it, they are usually overwhelmed by the sheer number of boxes, circles, arrows, lines, etc. So, you start to educate them about the visual language. So, half of your timeslot is wasted and people are too distracted. Often you feel you brought the wrong viewpoint or slide deck with you and you wish you could do it all over again.Leaving the models and standing at the whiteboard, you quickly, almost unconcious, learn what style of graphic design you can use in front of your audience. You draw, explain, listen, adapt and sometimes even people start to draw with you. That’s when you know, they are learning and co-creating the future with you.Focus on improvementI believe an Enterprise Architect main focus should be about improving the organisation rather than trying to control or govern it. Although the first has its purpose, improving and creating customer (/business) value is primordial imho.Most Enterprise Architects, including myself have a tendancy of starting with anas-is, then defining theto-beand making a plan for the difference, thegapin between these two states. Every time, I start with a formal language like Archimate I get sucked up in the formalism of the language and days, weeks go by where I’m deciding if it should be a full or open arrow. A lot of time gets wasted during the start of a project. Many organisations then decide to put much more time and effort into thisas-ismodels, so next time there’s a project, they can speed up their project kickoff.I haven’t made any factual comparison between doing this big up-front “let’s get everything charted out” exercises and “let’s draw an as-is when we really need it”. Let’s follow some logic here. Imagine a company with 4 sub-systems. If I were the model them in one go, I would spent as much as time than I would draw them seperately. Tbh, doing it in one go would be slightly faster. However, the big waste is in keeping the models up to date. Imagine that I changed the big as-is model 17 times over the coarse of a year, this would become far more expensive then drawing things when needed.So, don’t fall into the trap of “I believe I can model the organisation and keep the model up to date”.
